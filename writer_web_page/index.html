                    <h1>Redwall</h1>
                    <p><strong class="r">R</strong>edwall is a 22-book saga comprised of fantasy fiction novels,
                    accessories, eBooks and audio books that involve personified 
                    animals set in a medieval-esque time period; the first publishing 
                    occurred in 1986. The central building in the novels is Redwall Abbey,
                    a commune for peaceful creatures who are often found defending themselves
                    from villains who wish to destroy their ways of kindness.</p>

                        The characters in the books are divided into three groups.
                        The following consists of creatures generally considered as protagonists or "good guys":
                        Badgers, Bats, Rabbits, Hares, Otters, Moles, Mice, Seals.

                    <p>
                        In the Redwall books there is often a set of recurring themes.
                        The main theme is the battle of Good vs. Evil. 
                        Every book contains an epic battle between a hero and a monstrous villain, 
                        with the side of good winning each time.

                    <p>
                        The characters in the books overlap, so some characters can be found in several books
                        at once. Also in the books there are many references to other works, including
                        the Redwall series.
